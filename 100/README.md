# 100 - Introduction

We make use of DAKBoard application to show the Home Assistant interface on a HDMI-enabled monitor. With touchscreen we can manage the Home Assistant interface interactively (i.e. push buttons to execute commands such as turning lights on and off). The monitor can be placed outside of the Home Assistant home, such as in a office space or else, and still respond to actions by touch as well as still show the current state of devices connected to Home Assistant (such as sensors). With the DAKBOard CPU Mini we connect to the monitor through WiFi (not Ethernet).
